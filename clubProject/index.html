          <p>We cook! Whether you're completely new to cooking anything, a home cook looking for more ideas,

            so let's chat, cook, and have some fun!</p>

        <h2>Cooking Events &#127837; </h2>
          <p>For each event, we will be putting together a meal for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.
            We take suggestions, vote for our choice every week, and then we'll meet up and cook
            the meal together. Join us with your family and friends, and then enjoy the fruits
            of your labor together.</p>

        <h2>Cook with us! &#129386; </h2>
          <p>Some recipes may require tools that you may not be able to find at home or an ingredient
            that you have a difficult time finding or may not need otherwise. Never fear!
            You may join us in person and we will provide everything we need for the day's recipe.
            If you have most of the necessary tools and ingredients at home, you may choose to remain at home
            and simply join us for some cooking company.</p>
